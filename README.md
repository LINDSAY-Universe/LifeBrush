# LifeBrush
LifeBrush is a VR Unreal Engine 4 toolkit for creating interactive biomolecular illustrative simulations. Users paint molecules into a simulation (TileBrush style) in VR. A fast and powerful agent-based modeling framework drives those simulations, the framework is fully integrate into the Unreal Editor.

LifeBrush is fast. The generative brushes can synthesize thousands of molecules per second in volumes and on surfaces. The agent-based modeling framework is also fast, capable of simulating more than 10,000 agents at 90 fps in VR.

The C++ agent framework is based on an Entity-Component-System that we developed for Unreal Engine. Components are compact C++ structs. Entities organize multiple components into a single entity. We do not use Unreal's actor-component model because it cannot handle very large numbers of agents. Our ECS is the basis of our brush-based synthesis framework for painting agents and for simulating them.

This toolkit was orignally described in a conference paper in 2018, "LifeBrush: Painting interactive agent-based simulations" by Timothy Davison, Faramarz Samavati and Christian Jacob (the bibtex is below). The version here on GitHub is a significant evolution of that paper.

# Build instructions

Clone the repository and open the LifeBrush.uproject with Unreal Engine 4.18.

Requirements:
- Unreal Engine 4.18
- Windows 10
- At least an Nvidia GTX 1080
- HTC Vive

I haven't tested with an Oculus Rift, I'm pretty sure it won't work out of the box.

# Using LifeBrush

LifeBrush is designed to run within the Unreal Editor. You use the VR preview mode to enter the painting environment and to simulate. Changes can be saved back to the Unreal Editor world through the VR menus.

There are two demo levels, a bare mitochondrion ``mitochondrion_blank`` and one where the molecules have already been painted into a mitochondrial scene, ``mitochondrion_completed``.
